<h1>üê∂ End-to-End Multi-Class Dog Breed Classification</h1>
    <p>This project is an end-to-end multi-class image classifier designed to identify the breed of a dog from an image using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.</p>

  <h2>1. Problem</h2>
  <p>Given an image of a dog, the goal is to identify its breed from a set of 120 possible breeds. For example, when you take a photo of a dog at a cafe, the model can predict its breed.</p>

  <h2>2. Data</h2>
  <p>The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data" target="_blank">Dog Breed Identification Competition</a>. It contains:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>10,000+ labeled training images (120 breeds).</li>
      <li>10,000+ unlabeled test images for prediction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The model's performance is evaluated using a file containing prediction probabilities for each dog breed for each test image. Details of the evaluation metric can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>4. Features</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Leverages deep learning and transfer learning for image classification.</li>
      <li>120 distinct dog breeds (120 output classes).</li>
      <li>Dataset contains 10,000+ images for training and 10,000+ images for testing.</li>
      <li>Built with TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub for state-of-the-art performance.</li>
  </ul>
